Before starting the topic let me introduce myself. I am a Mobile Developer currently working in Warsaw and spending my free time for interview preparations. I started to prepare for interviews two years ago. At that time I should say I could not solve the two sum problem. Easy problems seemed to me like hard ones so most of the time I had to look at editorials and discuss section. Currently, I have solved ~800 problems and time to time participate in contests. I usually solve 3 problems in a contest and sometimes 4 problems. Ok, lets come back to the topic.

Recently I have concentrated my attention on Dynamic Programming cause its one of the hardest topics in an interview prep. After solving ~140 problems in DP I have noticed that there are few patterns that can be found in different problems. So I did a research on that and find the following topics. I will not give complete ways how to solve problems but these patterns may be helpful in solving DP.

Generate problem statement for this pattern

### Statement

> Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target.

### Approach

> Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.

for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
    result = min(result, topDown(target - ways[j]) + cost/ path / sum);
}

```

### Bottom-Up

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {

[375\. Guess Number Higher or Lower II](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/) `Medium`

## DP on Strings

---

Problem List: [https://leetcode.com/list/55afh7m7](https://leetcode.com/list/55afh7m7%C2%A0)

General problem statement for this pattern can vary but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big

### Statement

> Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `some result`.

### Approach

> Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.

```cpp
// i - indexing string s1
// j - indexing string s2
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
       if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
```

> If you are given one string `s` the approach may little vary

```cpp
for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
   for (int i = 0; i < n-l; ++i) {
       int j = i + l;
       if (s[i] == s[j]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {

## Decision Making

---

Problem List: [https://leetcode.com/list/55af7bu7](https://leetcode.com/list/55af7bu7%C2%A0)

The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires you to make a decision at a current state.

### Statement

> Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore the current value.

### Approach

> If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.

```cpp
// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
   }
}
```

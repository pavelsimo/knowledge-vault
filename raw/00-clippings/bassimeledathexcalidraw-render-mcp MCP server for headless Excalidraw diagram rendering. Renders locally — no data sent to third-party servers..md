## excalidraw-render

Headless Excalidraw diagram renderer for **Claude Code CLI** and other MCP clients. Renders hand-drawn diagrams as PNG or SVG — diagrams are rendered locally, not on Excalidraw's servers.

Uses headless Chromium (via [agent-browser](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser)) to render diagrams server-side. First render takes ~3s (browser launch + CDN import), subsequent renders ~60ms.

## How it works

[![[raw/00-clippings/images/bb7c9504f31ad49fe33f07bfecb314a3_MD5.png]]](https://github.com/bassimeledath/excalidraw-render-mcp/blob/main/architecture.png)

1. A headless Chromium browser is launched as a singleton
2. The browser navigates to [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) and dynamically imports `@excalidraw/excalidraw`
3. Elements are converted via `convertToExcalidrawElements()` and rendered to SVG via `exportToSvg()`
4. For PNG: Playwright takes an element-level screenshot of the SVG. For SVG: the markup is serialized directly to file.
5. The browser stays alive for subsequent renders (~60ms each)

## Install

### One command (npm)

```
# Claude Code
claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio excalidraw -- npx -y excalidraw-render

# Or with any MCP client
npx -y excalidraw-render
```

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/bassimeledath/excalidraw-render.git
cd excalidraw-render
npm install
npm run build

# Add to Claude Code
claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio excalidraw -- node /absolute/path/to/excalidraw-render/dist/index.js
```

### Claude Desktop / other clients

Add to your MCP config:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excalidraw": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "excalidraw-render"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `excalidraw_read_me` | Returns the Excalidraw element format reference (color palettes, element types, examples). Call once before drawing. |
| `create_excalidraw_diagram` | Renders an Excalidraw element JSON array to a PNG or SVG file. Returns the file path. |

## Usage

After installing, ask Claude to draw:

- "Draw an architecture diagram showing a FastAPI server connected to Redis and Gemini"
- "Create an Excalidraw diagram of the git branching model"
- "Sketch a flowchart for user authentication"

Claude will call `excalidraw_read_me` to learn the element format, then `create_excalidraw_diagram` with the element JSON. The file is saved to disk and the path is returned.

### create\_excalidraw\_diagram parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `elements` | string | yes | JSON array of Excalidraw elements (see format reference from `excalidraw_read_me`) |
| `outputPath` | string | no | Absolute path for the output file. Defaults to a temp file. |
| `format` | string | no | `"png"` (default) or `"svg"`. SVG outputs vector graphics that scale to any size without quality loss. |

## Privacy

Diagrams are rendered locally in a headless Chromium instance on your machine, not on Excalidraw's servers. The only network request is fetching the Excalidraw JavaScript library from esm.sh at startup — no diagram content is sent to third-party servers.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Chromium is installed automatically via `agent-browser install` (runs as a postinstall hook)

## Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by [excalidraw-mcp-app](https://github.com/antonpk1/excalidraw-mcp-app) by Anton Pk, which renders interactive Excalidraw diagrams inside Claude Desktop using MCP Apps (`ui://` resources). It's a great tool if you're using Claude Desktop with a browser surface.

**excalidraw-render** takes a different approach for a different use case:

|  | excalidraw-mcp-app | excalidraw-render |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Target** | Claude Desktop (browser) | Claude Code CLI (terminal) |
| **Rendering** | Client-side in browser UI | Server-side headless Chromium |
| **Output** | Interactive SVG in chat | PNG or SVG file on disk |
| **Dependencies** | React, MCP Apps ext | agent-browser, Playwright |
| **Privacy** | Renders in client app | Fully local, no data sent externally |
